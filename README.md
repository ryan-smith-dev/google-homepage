The Odin Project - google-homepage project

Details: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav

Created a copy of google's homepage from scratch (aesthetically, no functionality)

For a preview, look here: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ryan-smith-dev/google-homepage/master/index.html

This doesn't use images in the top navbar as the image file they are pulled from is a collection of images and I didn't feel like cropping them out for this so I just put the text. /laziness
